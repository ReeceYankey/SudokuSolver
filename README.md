# SudokuSolver
Solves a sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. It also has the ability to take a screenshot of a puzzle and automatically solve it for you using tesseract. I also made a decorator in PerformanceTimer.py to gauge the performance of the algorithm and help me identify bottlenecks
# Dependencies
use pip install on the following:
1. Pillow
2. pytesseract
# Setup
1. install [tesseract-ocr](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Downloads.html)
2. modify the directory for tesseract in SolveImage.py if necessary
